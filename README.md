```Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learners, owned by Google, Inc. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.```

This repository contains my solutions to different Kaggle competitions and Datasets. Included best techniques and recreated results competitions winner plus kernels from Kaggle Data Notes.
