    Kaggle is an online community of data scientists and machine learners, owned by Google, Inc. 
    Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based 
    data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, 
    and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

## Objective
The purpose this repository serves is it contains my implementation or re-implementation of Kaggle Kernels.
  ##### * Kaggle Competitions
